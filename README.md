# mosh-game-hub

A clone of the Game Hub website - a type-along tutorial app as part of [Mosh's React 18 course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1).

Live version [here](https://iankulin.github.io/mosh-game-hub/).

## Stack
* React/Typescript/Vite
* ChakraUI/Axios/

## Changes from the course
There are some very minor changes compared to the [Mosh version](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/react-course-part1)
- using an API proxy so it could be deployed on github without exposing my API key
- Making all the cards the same height with the TwoLineHeading component
- truncating the Genre names if too long
